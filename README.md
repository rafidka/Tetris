I coded this Tetris game back in 1999 using C++ and Game Class Library, a library which [my brother](https://github.com/sarmadka) developed using DirectX. The code as it is right now won't compile, as I need to bring the code of Game Class Library. Additionally, the code was developed using VC 6 (if I recall correctly) on Windows 98, so I am not sure it is going to be easy to compile it on a recent version of Windows and Visual Studio. Nevertheless, it is good have it on GitHub. I will update this README if I manage to re-compile the code.

What reminded me of this code, which made its way through multiple hard drives until it finally landed on my Dropbox drive, is that my family members and I recently started playing Tetris on PS4 and, since I am doing machine learning these days, I thought I would try to apply what I learn in Machine Learning on implementing an AI Tetris player :-)
